This app was developed over the course of a month by a team of designers as part of a COSC 1336 class at Lone Star College. It is meant to be an intuitive and complete guide to coding in C++. Learners can start off in the tutorials section, soaking up basics of OOP, or experienced developers can refer back to the handy and beautiful documentation, laid out in Material Design.
